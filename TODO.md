(in some particular order):

- [x] rotate/translate sun according to zenith angle
- [ ] different aa methods (ms, fx, ss) - possibly taa but i dont really like it
- [ ] custom clouds
- [ ] camera effects
  - [ ] bloom
  - [ ] depth of field
  - [ ] motion blur? (i dont really like it but it could be fun)
  - [ ] lens flare
  - [ ] chromatic aberration
  - [ ] vignette (maybe)
- [ ] cool sky/stars at night
- [ ] actually replace lighting maybe
- [ ] reflections/normals
- [ ] handheld lights

bugs to fix:
- shadows are really jarring and flickery during sunrise/sunset
- sun rotation doesn't apply with shadows off
- sun rotation + posterization is weird
- caves look really weird and are too bright
